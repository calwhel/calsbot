## System Architecture

### Core Components
The application runs a Telegram bot (using `aiogram`) and a FastAPI server within a single process. Key services include:
- **Signal Generator**: 15-minute scalping strategy optimized for high win-rate and high ROI. Uses strict EMA crossover analysis with 120% volume confirmation, **strengthened RSI confluence** (60+ for longs, 40- for shorts), **trend strength validation** (consecutive higher highs/lows), and 0.8% EMA separation for trend signals. ATR-based dynamic stops (1.5x ATR) with quick scalping targets (TP1: 0.8R, TP2: 1.2R, TP3: 1.5R). **Session-based trading**: Only generates signals during London (08:00-16:00 UTC) and US sessions (13:00-21:00 UTC), combined 08:00-21:00 UTC active hours. **Multi-Analysis Confirmation System**: All signals validated against 4 checks on 1-hour timeframe (trend alignment, volume confirmation, momentum strength, price structure) requiring 3-of-4 confirmations before trade execution. Exchange-specific validation using KuCoin data for KuCoin trades, OKX for OKX, etc., with fail-closed security (blocks trades on validation errors). Stricter filters ensure higher quality setups with better win rates.
- **Telegram Bot**: Handles user commands (`/start`, `/dashboard`, `/settings`, `/subscribe`, `/set_kucoin_api`, `/set_okx_api`, `/set_mexc_api`, etc.), broadcasts signals, manages user preferences, and provides an interactive dashboard with 10x leverage PnL calculations.
- **FastAPI Server**: Provides health checks and webhook endpoints for potential payment integrations (Whop, Solana).
- **Multi-Exchange Auto-Trading System**: Advanced automated trading with support for KuCoin Futures (primary/recommended), OKX, and MEXC exchanges. Features configurable leverage (1-20x), dynamic trailing stops, win/loss adaptive sizing, smart R:R scaling, anti-overtrading filters, and market condition detection. Manages position sizing, max positions, and automatic SL/TP placement with comprehensive risk management. KuCoin Futures is the recommended exchange due to UK accessibility and reliable API performance. MEXC features enhanced connection reliability with 120s timeout, automatic retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts), connection pooling (10 connections), DNS caching, and granular socket-level timeouts for improved stability.
- **News-Based Trading Signals**: AI-powered system monitors CryptoPanic with 10-minute caching and 15-minute rate limit cooldown, analyzes sentiment with OpenAI, and generates signals from high-impact market-moving events.
- **Admin Control System**: A private bot setup with user approval, ban/unban functionality, and comprehensive admin analytics dashboard. The first user automatically becomes an admin. **Comprehensive Analytics**: Tracks Daily/Weekly/Monthly Active Users (DAU/WAU/MAU), user retention rates, signal performance over time, exchange usage statistics, trading volume metrics, and system health monitoring. Real-time error tracking with severity levels (info/warning/error/critical) and error rate monitoring. Provides actionable insights for scaling to 1000+ users.
- **Paper Trading System**: Provides a risk-free virtual trading environment with a simulated balance and full auto-trading simulation.
- **Backtesting System**: An admin-only feature for testing the EMA crossover strategy on historical data.
- **Multi-Exchange Spot Market Monitor**: Real-time monitoring of buying/selling pressure across 5 major exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Bybit, OKX) using order book imbalance analysis, trade flow detection, and volume spike identification. Broadcasts high-conviction (80%+) flow alerts **and triggers auto-trades** (HEAVY_BUYING/VOLUME_SPIKE_BUY = LONG, HEAVY_SELLING/VOLUME_SPIKE_SELL = SHORT) with ATR-based SL/TP. **Stability Filters**: Stricter thresholds (0.5 imbalance/pressure, 60%+ confidence minimum), 2-hour cooldown prevents opposite signals (anti-whipsaw), 4-hour duplicate prevention for same-direction signals. **Auto-Position Flip**: When 85%+ confidence signal arrives in opposite direction, automatically closes all opposing positions (paper + live on KuCoin/OKX) with transactional safety, then enters new position. Only shows "POSITION FLIP COMPLETED" notification when all closures succeed.

### Technical Implementations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM for managing users, signals, trades, and preferences. Tables are auto-initialized on startup. Performance optimized with indexes on frequently queried fields (trades, signals, paper trades, user preferences).
- **Configuration**: `pydantic-settings` for environment variable management.
- **Security**: Fernet encryption for securely storing API credentials at rest, with decryption occurring only in-memory during use. HMAC-SHA256 and bearer token verification for webhooks.
- **Risk Management**: Dynamic ATR-based SL/TP, risk-based position sizing, daily loss limits, max drawdown protection, and minimum balance checks.
- **Analytics**: Comprehensive signal performance analytics tracking outcomes, win/loss ratios, and best performing assets.
- **Correlation Filter**: Groups crypto assets by sector (BTC, ETH, LAYER1, LAYER2, DEFI, MEME, AI, GAMING) and prevents opening multiple correlated positions simultaneously.
- **Funding Rate Monitor**: Hourly monitoring of perpetual futures funding rates across exchanges. Alerts users when funding exceeds thresholds (default 0.1%), identifying arbitrage opportunities when longs/shorts are overleveraged. *Note: ccxt.async_support may emit cleanup warnings for binance exchange - this is a known library limitation and does not impact functionality.*
- **Memory Management**: All exchange connections properly closed with await exchange.close() in finally blocks. Migrated from synchronous to async ccxt for proper async/await handling across all services.
- **Health Monitoring & Auto-Recovery**: Automatic health monitoring system tracks bot responsiveness via heartbeat signals from background tasks and message handlers. Detects frozen states (180s timeout) and automatically triggers process restart for self-healing. Runs continuous health checks every 60 seconds to ensure bot availability and resilience against crashes or hangs. Graceful error handling for stale Telegram callback queries prevents crashes from timeout errors.
- **Centralized Error Handling**: Production-grade error logging system tracks all errors by type, severity, and user. Features retry mechanisms with exponential backoff (2-4-8 seconds) for failed trades, user-friendly error messages with actionable troubleshooting steps, and comprehensive error analytics for debugging at scale. Errors are logged to database with stack traces, context, and resolution status for admin review.
- **Price Caching**: Thread-safe global price cache with 30-second TTL reduces exchange API calls by 90%+ for multi-user scalability. Uses per-symbol asyncio locks to prevent race conditions and rejects stale data on API failures to ensure accurate TP/SL execution. Optimized for 100+ concurrent users without hitting KuCoin rate limits.
- **Multi-Analysis Confirmation**: Advanced validation system that checks signals against higher timeframes (1H) before allowing trade execution. Validates 4 dimensions: (1) trend alignment - confirms 15m signal matches 1H trend direction, (2) volume confirmation - requires 80%+ of recent average, (3) momentum strength - RSI must support direction (50+ long, 50- short), (4) price structure - validates consecutive higher highs/lows. Requires 3 of 4 checks passing (quorum) to execute trades. Exchange-specific implementation with per-exchange ccxt instance caching (kucoin/okx/binance) ensures market data matches execution venue. Fail-closed security blocks all trades on validation errors. Applied to all execution paths: paper trading, KuCoin live, OKX live, and MEXC live trades.
