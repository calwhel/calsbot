## Overview
A Python-based Telegram bot designed to generate and broadcast cryptocurrency perpetual futures day trading signals with **1:1 risk-reward ratio**. It employs a strict **6-point confirmation system** requiring trend alignment, spot buying/selling pressure from Binance + 3 exchanges, volume spikes, momentum confirmation, clean candle patterns, and high liquidity session validation. Signals feature **15% TP / 15% SL** (1.5% price move with 10x leverage) for consistent, high-probability entries with automated execution on **Bitunix exchange**. The bot offers free signals, PnL tracking, paper trading, and comprehensive risk management for day trades only. The project aims to provide pinpoint entries with high success rates.

## Recent Changes (Oct 24, 2025)
- **ðŸŽ¯ 1:1 DAY TRADING STRATEGY OVERHAUL**: Completely redesigned signal system after data analysis showed poor entry quality. NEW FEATURES:
  - **6-Point Confirmation System**: Every signal requires ALL confirmations: (1) EMA trend alignment 15m+1H, (2) Spot buying/selling pressure from Binance+3 exchanges >60%, (3) Volume spike >2x average, (4) RSI+MACD momentum alignment, (5) Clean candle pattern (engulfing/hammer/rejection), (6) High liquidity session only (8am-11pm UTC)
  - **1:1 Risk-Reward**: Single 15% TP / 15% SL (1.5% price move @ 10x leverage) - no more multi-TP complexity
  - **Binance Spot Monitor**: Added Binance to spot flow tracking for most accurate buying/selling pressure data
  - **Removed Underperforming Patterns**: Deleted DOUBLE_TOP (0% win rate), funding extremes, weak divergence, and all reversal patterns - keeping only proven EMA crossover + spot flow confirmation
  - **Day Trading Focus**: Signals optimized for same-day closes with pinpoint entries
- **Pattern Performance Analytics**: Added `/pattern_performance` admin command to track win rate, avg PnL, and trade count per pattern. Database analysis revealed SHORTs only profited from manual early exits, LONGs had 0% win rate - confirming need for complete strategy rebuild.
